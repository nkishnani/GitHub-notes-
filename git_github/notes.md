# Git / GitHub Notes

Many thanks to [Brian Hung](https://github.com/brianhung) for his help in navigating both Git and Markdown. This is being edited on [Typora](https://typora.io), a minimalist Markdown editor.

#### What is Git?

- Git is a **DVCS**, or distributed version control software. A recent [StackOverflow poll](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/) found that Git is used by ~70% of developers worldwide, making it the most popular DVCS. 
- Version control software is used to enhance the software development environment. When multiple people are working on several files for a project, there is a high likelihood for overlapping work and a lack of clarity on responsibilities. Git aims to fix this.
- Git does this by allowing for all developers in a project to be able to see all changes being made to the files in the project, or **respository**. All changes are tracked via Git, and versions of the files can be seen or reverted to at all times.
